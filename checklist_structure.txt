1. Configuration and start:
    - With correct parameters:
        -- Values for SOURCE_DIR, DESTINATION_DIR, LOG_FILE_NAME are passed to the application. These values (all of them) should contain spaces and Cyrillic symbols. Repeat this test for Windows and *nix file systems (pay attention to directory separators (“/” и “\”) and logical drives).
        -- LOG_FILE_NAME value is omitted.
    - Without any parameter.
    - With some mandatory parameters omitted.
    - With incorrect parameters:
        -- Wrong path for SOURCE_DIR.
        -- Wrong path for DESTINATION_DIR.
        -- Wrong file name for LOG_FILE_NAME.
        -- DESTINATION_DIR is inside SOURCE_DIR.
        -- DESTINATION_DIR and SOURCE_DIR are the same.
2. File processing:
    - Miscellaneous formats, encodings and sizes.
    - Inaccessible input files:
        -- No access rights.
        -- File is opened and locked.
        -- File with "read-only" attribute.
3. Stop:
    - Close the console window (do not use Ctrl-C).
4. Log:
    - Creation (if no log was created yet).
    - Appending (for the existing log) with application restart.
5. Performance:
    - Execute some elementary rough test.
